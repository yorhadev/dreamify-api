# Dreamify API

Dreamify API is a free **but limited** wrapper around [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) that you can use to generate text to image made from AI without running any server-side code. It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, tests and etc.

## Why?

I wanted to design a portfolio project prototype that showed my knowledge as a Full-Stack developer, so I decided to create this simple web service with NodeJs (express).

## How to

you can fetch data with any kind of methods you know(fetch API, Axios, jquery, ajax,...)

### Create image

```js
// TODO
fetch("...");
```
